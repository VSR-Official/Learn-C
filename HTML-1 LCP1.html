<h1 class=main-heading>Programming</h1>
<p class=basic-para>Programming is the medium for humans to communicate with computers.<br><br></p>
<p class=basic-para>Programming reffers to process of creating and giving instructions and commands to
computer. These instructions and commands are written in various coding or progamming languages. This
languages are easily understood by computer and the computer performs the operations and tasks it is
instructed to do by executing the commands or programs written using these languages.<br><br>Basically,
programming is used to tell the computers what operation they need to perform. The computer executes
these programs and give the desired result as output.
</p>
<p class=basic-para><br>One of the most popular programming language is C, about which we will be
studying.</p>

all modern languages. It was first computer language to use a block structure, it gave the
concept of structured programming.</p>

<h1 class=language_name>B</h1>
<p class="language_description basic-para">Developed by Ken Thompson, in 1970. Ken used many
features of BCPL to develop B (thus the name from BCPL i.e. B). B was also a typless programming
language and was used to create early versions of UNIX operating system at Bell Laboratories.

<h1 class=language_name>C</h1>
<p class="language_description basic-para">In 1972, Dennis Ritchie developed C programming language
at Bell Laboratories. C uses many concepts of ALGOL, BCPL and B and added concepts of data types
and many other powerful features. Since C was developed along with UNIX OS, UNIX was coded
almost entirely in C.</p>

<h1 class=language_name>K&R C</h1>
<p class="language_description basic-para">In 1978, Brian Kerningham and Dennis Ritchie published
the book <q>The C Programming Language</q>. The book became so popular, that C was also known as
<q>K&R C.</q>

<p class="language_description basic-para">Due to development of different versions of C, in 1983,
<strong>A</strong>merican <strong>N</strong>ational <strong>S</strong>tandards
<strong>I</strong>nstitute (ANSI) appointed a technical committee to define a standard for C.
The committee approved a version of C in December 1989, known as ANSI C.

<section class="curved_border_black_wp sec-whpm">
<h1 class=main-heading>Features Of C</h1>
<ul class=basic-para>
<li>Efficiency: C provides low-level memory access and allows for direct manipulation of hardware and
memory through pointers and also provides the high-level constructs such as functions, loops,
conditionals, data types and powerfull operators, thus C combines the capabilites of low-level
language with features of high-level language, this is the reason for programs written in C being
efficient.</li><br>
<li>Simplicity: C has a easy to understand syntax.</li><br>
<li>Portability: Programs written in C can be run on different types of machines with little or no
modification.</li><br>
<li>Modularity: C supports modular programming through functions, it makes code organised and allows
code to reused and makes program easier to read, understand, debbug, test and maintain.</li><br>
<li>Pointers: Pointer arithmetic in C allows dynamic memory allocation.</li><br>
<li>Speed: The low-level capabilities and efficiency of C makes C the most fastest programming language.
</li><br>
<li>Extedability: The C provides a vast number of libraries and functions, which can be further extended
to increase the capability of the language.</li><br>
<li>Memory Efficient: C programs consume very low memory.</li>
</ul>

<section class="curved_border_black_wp sec-whpm">
<h1 class=main-heading>Applications of C</h1>
<ul class=basic-para>
<li>C is used in development of Operating Systems like UNIX, Linux, Windows.</li><br>
<li>C is widely used in embedded systems programming for microcontrollers and real-time systems due to
its memory and working efficiency and control over the hardware.</li><br>
<li>C is also used to develop system softwares as well as business packages.</li><br>
<li>Database Management Systems like MySQL and PostgreSQL use C for performance critical-components.
</li><br>
<li>Many compilers and interpreters for many programming languges are implemented using C.</li><br>
<li>C is used in the development of Graphic engines and Games due to its speed and efficiency.</li><br>
<li>C is also used in IoT (Internet Of Things).</li><br>
<li>C is used to develop network protocols and applications due to its high efficiency and low-level
memory access.</li><br>
<li>Many web servers, like Apache and Nginx, are written in C to handle large number of requests
efficiently.</li>
